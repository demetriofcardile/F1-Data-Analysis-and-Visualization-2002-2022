# F1-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-2002-2022
The project, carried out for a BSc Course in Databases and Big Data, is an in-depth analysis of Formula 1 data from 2002 to 2022. Initially sourced from a comprehensive collection covering F1 history from 1950 to 2022, the project narrows down to the last 20 years, involving six files and 39 columns of data. The analysis includes creating an ER diagram and a logical schema, developing an interactive application for querying the data, and presenting various queries such as total pit stops by season for specific drivers and ranking drivers by nationality.
